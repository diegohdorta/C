`Machine Learning` make our minds probably deliberate about robots and talkings machines, some of us might even related ML to robots bent on destroying the world. However, this technology is more about building intelligent systems with decision making abilities.

Think about `Machine Learning` as a subfield of AI that can analyse large amounts of data and automate analytical model building. This branch of Artificial Intelligence was born from [`pattern recognition`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition) and the theory that computer can learn, and have the ability to independently draw knowledge from experience.

Historically, AI programs typically excelled at just on feature, like the [`Deep Blue`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)) computer, that could play chess in a high level championship, but that's all it could do. Today, large data centers and huge storage capacities make things, that were believed for years to be distants concepts, possible.

`Machine Learning` exists solely as software, but for most cases ML requires the use of Hardware components to build intelligent machines. Having a basic form, ML combined with embedded systems can reach significant improvements in image and video recognition, and the reason is due a certain level of smartness that embedded systems reached over the last years. This also explains the cause it has been gaining space and moment in several types of industrial processes nowadays.

This field boils down on spending time to write many lines of code that eventually solve a problem by applying some type of `intelligent` algorithm. For instance, some smart homes have lighting systems that automatically turn on and off based on whether anyone is present in the room. The system does not amuse, but when you start thinking about it, you realize that the system is actually making decision on its own.

The much-needed algorithms required for real-time image and video recognition are being developed and will get us quickly. Not just that, several types of algorithms for different issues the future is reserving for us, and the embedded systems world is fully prepared to completely replace the work of a human being :)

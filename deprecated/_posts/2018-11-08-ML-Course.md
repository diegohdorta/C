This course has a purpose to provide an initial and also deeper contact with a practical
view and details behind `Machine Learning` methods. The _minimal requirements_ for this 
course is to have a little _math background_ and _knowledge in programming languages_.

Before starting, the focus of this course is to approach the `Scikit-learn`, `Tensorflow`,
`Keras` and `Numpy` frameworks. Since these libraries uses _Python_, make sure you
have read the previous posts about fundamentals concepts of it:

- [`Python Course 101`](https://diegodorta.com.br/artificial/Python-Course-101.html)
- [`Python Course 201`](https://diegodorta.com.br/artificial/Python-Course-201.html)
- [`Python Course 301`](https://diegodorta.com.br/artificial/Python-Course-301.html)

Numpy underlies most _Python_ `ML` packages and it is great for performing quick
sketches or working through calculations. _Tensorflow_ is quickly gaining popularity
and it seems poised  to become `ML` standard library, given its GPU support, performance
development support (_Google_), and distributed computation abilities.

Human being and machines are different, but what makes them different from each other?
The mainly difference between them is that a human being _learn from past experience_,
whereas _computers_ need to be programmed to follow written instructions, in other
words, they **do not learn**.

Machines can learn from experience too? Yes, it is possible. This is precisely
what `Machine Learning` does. However, for machines the _past experiences_ has other
name, it is called `data`.

From now on, the next examples shows how _computers_ can learn from previous `data`,
and most important to see these algorithms are actually easy, and there is nothing
to be afraid. --->

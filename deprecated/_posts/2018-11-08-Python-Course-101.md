In most of the programming languages a variable is a named location used to store
data in the _memory_. Each variable must have a unique name called _identifier_.
It is helpful to think of variables as container that hold data which can be
changed later _throughout programming_.

Non technically, you can suppose variable as a bag to store books in it and those
books can be replaced at anytime.

**Note**: In _Python_ we don't assign values to the variables, whereas _Python_
gives the reference of the object (value) to the variable.

In _Python_, variables do not need declaration to reserve memory space.
The "variable declaration" or "variable initialization" happens automatically
when we assign a value to a variable.ยน

### Hello World Example

Follow the `Hello World` example in _C_ language:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Hello World!\n");
	return 0;
}
```
To compile this example you just need to use _gcc_:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall example.c -o helloworld
```
Run the generated binary code by:

```bash
$ ./helloworld
```
The same example in _Python3_:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello World!")
```
_Python_ is interpreted, so you have two ways for running this code. One way is
using the _Python_ in the terminal:

```bash
$ python3 example.py
```
The other way and most appropriate one is to set _**shebang**_ line that defines where
the interpreter is located. A _**shebang**_ line can be written in two forms:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
This case specifies that the _Python3_ interpreter is located in `/usr/bin/python3`,
and this can be used for _**bash**_, _**ruby**_, _**perl**_ or any other _scripting languages interpreter_.

The _OS_ does not know it is a _Python_ script if you do not set the execution _flag_ in
the script, give it permission to execute and run it like:

```bash
$ chmod +x example.py
$ ./example.py
```
You can use `/usr/bin/env python3` for portability across different platforms.
This can guarantee the execution even if the `language interpreter` is installed
in different locations.

*Recommended*:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

Even if the process for these two programming languages are different, the
`Hello World` codes are equivalent and have the same output:

```output
Hello World
```

### Data types in Python

There are many data types in _Python_, and everything is an object in _Python_
programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance of these
classes.

_Python_ has *six* standard data types. Some of the important types are listed below:

- [`Numbers`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/numbers.html)

_Python numbers_ are integers, floating point numbers and complex numbers that
falls under _Python_ numbers category. They are defined as `int`, `float` and
complex class in _Python_.

We can use the _type()_ function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

var = 10
print(var)
print(type(var))
```
The output:

```output
10
<class 'int'>
```
- [`String`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#module-string)

_Python string_ is a sequence of `Unicode` characters. We can use single quotes
or double quotes to represent _strings_. Multi-line strings can be denoted using
triple quotes, `'''` or `"""`. Index starts form **0** in _Python_. Follow an example:

```python
var = 'Hello world!'

print("var[4] = ", var[4])
print("var[6:11] = ", var[6:11])
```
The output:

```output
var[4] =  o
var[6:11] =  world
```
_Strings are_ _**immutable**_. This means that you should think variable in _Python_ as
a _tag_. You can move the _tag_ to different objects:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

var = "course"
print(var)
print(type(var))

var = 10
print(var)
print(type(var))
```
The output:

```output
course
<class 'str'>
10
<class 'int'>
```

_var_ can point to different objects, since all variables in _Python_ are objects.
However, immutability refers to the object, not the _tag_. If you try to
`var[1] = "a"` to turn `Hello` into `Hallo` you would get the error:

```error
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment"
```

This is because _strings_ in _Python_ does not support *item assignment*, thus
they are _**immutable**_.

- [`List`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

_Python list_ is an ordered sequence of items. It is one of the most used `data type`
in _Python_ and is very `flexible`. All the items in a list do not need to be of
the same type. Declaring a list is **pretty straight forward**. Items separated
by _commas_ are enclosed within _brackets_ `[]`.

```python
>>> list = [1, 2.2, 'python']
```
We can use the slicing operator `[]` to extract an item or a range of items
from a list. Example:

```python
var = [5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40]

print("var[2] = ", var[2])
print("var[0:3] = ", var[0:3])
print("var[5:] = ", var[5:])
```

The output:

```output
var[2] =  15
var[0:3] =  [5, 10, 15]
var[5:] =  [30, 35, 40]
```
_Lists are_ _**mutable**_, meaning, value of elements of a list can be altered.

- [`Tuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)

_Python tuple_ is an ordered sequence of items same as list. The only difference
is that _tuples are_ _**immutable**_. Tuples once created **can not be modified**.

Tuples are used to _write-protect_ data and are usually `faster` than list as it
**can not change dynamically**.

It is defined within parentheses `()` where items are separated by commas:

```python
>>> t = (10,'course', 1+10j)
```
We can use the slicing operator `[]` to extract items, but we can not change its
_value_.

```python
t = (10,'course', 1+10j)

print("t[1] = ", t[1])
print("t[0:3] = ", t[0:3])
```
The output:

```output
t[1] =  course
t[0:3] =  (10, 'course', (1+10j))
```
- [`Dictionary`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

_Python dictionary_ is an unordered collection of `key-value pairs`. It is generally
used when we have a huge _amount of data_. Dictionaries are optimized for _retrieving data_.
We must know the key to retrieve the value.

In _Python_, dictionaries are defined within braces `{}` with each item being a
pair in the form `key:value`. Key and value can be of any type.

```python
>>> d = {1:'value','key':2}
>>> type(d)
<class 'dict'>
```
We use `key` to retrieve the respective value, but _**not**_ _the other way around_.

```python
d = {1:'value','key':2}

print(type(d))
print("d[1] = ", d[1]);
print("d['key'] = ", d['key']);
```
The output:

```output
<class 'dict'>
d[1] =  value
d['key'] =  2
```
- [`Set`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

_Python set_ is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values
separated by comma inside braces `{}`. Items in a set are not ordered.

We can perform set operations like union, intersection on two sets. Set have
unique values. They eliminate duplicates:

```python
>>> a = {1,2,2,3,3,3}
>>> a
{1, 2, 3}
```
Set in _Python_ are unordered collection, indexing has **no meaning**. Hence the
slicing operator [] does not work:

```python
>>> a = {1,2,3}
>>> a[1]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 301, in runcode
  File "<interactive input>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing
```

### Rules and Naming Convention

Follow **rules** and **naming** convention for variables and constants:

- Create a name that **makes sense**. Suppose, _vowel_ makes more sense than _v_.
- Use [`camelCase`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) notation to declare
a variable. It starts with _lowercase_ letter. For example:

```output
myName
myAge
myAddress
```
- Use capital letters where possible to declare a constant. For example:

```output
PI
G
MASS
TEMP
```
- Never use special symbols like `!, @, #, $, %`, etc.
- Don't start name with a digit.
- Constants are put into _Python_ modules and meant not be changed.
- Constant and variable names should have combination of letters in lowercase
`(a to z)` or uppercase `(A to Z)` or digits `(0 to 9)` or an underscore `(_)`.

```output
snake_case
MACRO_CASE
camelCase
CapWords
```
### File, Functions, Exception

The following code shows a few concepts of a programming language. In this example,
it is explore how to *open* a file, *writing* and *reading* it. _Python_ has a `built-in`
function `open()` to open a file. This function returns a `file object`, also called
a handle, as it is used to read or modify the file accordingly:

```python
1  #!/usr/bin/env python3
2
3  def open_file(file):
4    try:
5      fd = open(file, "w", encoding = "utf-8")
6      fd.write("Python Course\n")
7    except:
8      raise ValueError
9    finally:
10      fd.close()
11   return
12
13 def read_file(file):
14   with open(file, "r", encoding = "utf-8") as f:
15     print(f.read())
16   return
17
18 def main():
19   print("Calling open_file() function")
20   open_file("test.txt")
21
22   print("Calling read_file() function")
23   read_file("test.txt")
24
25 if __name__ == "__main__":
26   main()
```
This code you can probably see `encoding = "utf-8"`, unlike other languages, the
character `a` does not imply the number `97` until it is encoded using `ASCII`
(or other equivalent encoding). Moreover, the default encoding is platform dependent.

In _Windows_, it is used `cp1252`, but in *GNU/Linux* is `utf-8`. So, we must not
rely on the default encoding or else our code will behave differently in different
platforms.ยน Hence, when working with files in text mode, it is highly recommended
to specify the encoding type.

We need to properly close the file, closing a file will free up the resources that
were tied with the file and is done using _Python_ `close()` method as line _10_.

_Python_ has a
[`garbage collector`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))
to clean up _unreferenced objects_, but we must not rely on it to close the file.

This method is not _entirely safe_. If an exception occurs when we are performing
some operation with the file, the code exits without closing the file.

A safer way is to use a _try_ and _finally_ block. This way, we are guaranteed that
the file is properly closed even if an `exception` is raised, causing program flow
to stop.

The best way to do this is using the `with` statement as line _14_. This ensures
that the file is closed when the block inside with is exited. We don't need to
explicitly call the `close()` method. It is done _internally_.

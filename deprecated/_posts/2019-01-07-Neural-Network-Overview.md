Neural networks are used as a method of deep learning or deep learning, one of
several subfields of artificial intelligence. They were first proposed about 70
years ago as an attempt to simulate the way the human brain works, albeit in a
much simpler way. The individual "neurons" are connected in layers, with weights
assigned to determine how the neuron responds when signals are propagated through
the network. Previously, neural networks were limited in the number of neurons
they were able to simulate and therefore the learning complexity they could
achieve, but in recent years, due to advances in hardware development, we have
been able to build very deep networks and train them on huge datasets or data
sets to gain breakthroughs in machine intelligence.

These innovations allowed the machines to match and exceed the ability of humans
to perform certain tasks. One of these tasks is object recognition. Although
machines have historically been unable to match human vision, recent advances
in deep learning have made it possible to construct neural networks capable
of recognizing objects, faces, texts, and even emotions.

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Machine Learning</code> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Deep Learning</code></a> are two branches of AI that use the possibilities of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Big Data</code></a> (a huge amount of data is well known as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Big Data</code>) to optimize processes, find new solutions, and gain new insights. Keep in mind that ML is a kind of intelligence developed as a result of excellent experiments, this type of intelligence can make machines and devices think and act like human beings. On the other hand, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deep Learning</code> is the process that implement ML. These fields combined will lead the World into an <em>exponential growth</em>.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Differently from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Deep Blue</code>, the currently programs can solve manu problems without needing to be rewritten. Put differently, ML is the study of algorithms that learn from examples and experiences instead of relying on <strong>hard-coded rules</strong>. These Algorithms can make predictions based on a huge amount of data, just by recognizing aspects and relations. For instance, think about the following situation where is required to write a code ro recognizer two types of fruit. How this can be solved? In a first approach, it seems to be easy, but it is almost impossible to solve without ML.</p>

<h3 id="types-of-fruits">Types of Fruits</h3>

<p>This fruit example takes an image file as input, analyses it and output the types of fruit. To start developing this code it would be necessary to write lots of manual rules. That works fine for simple images, but as <code class="highlighter-rouge">deeper it dives into the problem, more messy it gets and the writeen rules starts to break down</code>. How simples rules can handle <code class="highlighter-rouge">black-and-white</code> photos or images with no fruits at all? In fact, for just about aby rule it is possible to find an image where it will not work for sure. After spending manu hours it can get there, but that’s just to tell the difference between two types of fruit. The problem begins on any new problem, where it is necessary to start all over again and write more fules for the new issue.</p>

<h2 id="learning-the-games-rules">Learning the Game’s Rules</h2>

<p>Clearly it requires something better. The ML can solve this problem using an algorithm that can figure out the rules itself, by recognizing patterns and draws conclusions from data without the necessary to write them by hand, and its findings can be used further as well. The most commonly used learning method is <code class="highlighter-rouge">image recognition</code>, other uses examples are: <em>digital assistants</em> or <em>intelligents bots</em>, <em>face recognition</em>, <em>speech recognition</em>, <em>natural language processing</em>, <em>automated translation</em>, and the trending one <em>autonomous car</em>.</p>

<h2 id="40-industrial">4.0 Industrial</h2>

<p>Known as <code class="highlighter-rouge">The Fourth Industrial Revolution or 4.0 Industry</code>, that in fact is happening right now, this concept consists in a smart factory where production processes are connected, such as machines, interfaces and components communicating each other. Large amounts of data can be collected to optimize the manufacturing process, and AI expected to influence the growth of these companies by using the ML field.</p>

<p>The industries are already using the AI in maintenance and support services by capturing the energy comsumption of individual machines, analyzing maintenance cycles, and then optmizing them in the following stage. As the amount of data icrases, the system becomes better at optimizing itself and making more accurated predictions.</p>

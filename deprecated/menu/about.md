title: about me
---

Well, my name is `Diego Dorta` and I am a full-time _application engineer_ and
technologically inclined with a penchant for playing music, sketching, coding,
cooking, riddles, astronomy and crazy ideas that generally are just for having
fun and exploring the world around me.

My personality ranges from being overly patient to somewhere on the autism
spectrum, which can often lead me on flights of fancy -- in fact, one of my
many over-arching goals before dying is to travel around the world and see
what it's all about it.

This blog has my personal notes, which are broadly intented to provide knowledge
about stuff I think is useful. Take as a disclaimer that most of these notes are
adapted and sometimes directly copied from elsewhere. I'm lazy enough for not
including references, that being said for my owns I take no credit at all.
